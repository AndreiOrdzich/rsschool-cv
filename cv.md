#### About me

I have been interested in frontend technologies for a long time. I like to constantly learn something new and immediately put it into practice. I have my main job and programming is my hobby. I have taken many frontend courses and would like to participate in a real project. My immediate goal is to learn JavaScript and TypeScript at a good level and further learn the React library. I would be happy to gain practical experience in various open source projects in order to gain practical experience under the guidance of experienced developers.
